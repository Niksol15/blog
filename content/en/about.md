Hey, I'm Nikita Solonko — a C++ developer based in Chernihiv, Ukraine.

Currently working at Atto Trading on low-latency HFT platform development.
Before that, I spent three and a half years at GlobalLogic building safety-critical automotive middleware for Volvo/Polestar.

I'm also pursuing a Master's online at Georgia Tech (OMSCS).
Got my Bachelor's from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Faculty of Computer Science and Cybernetics.
My thesis was on elliptic curve cryptography.
I have Stanford certificates in compilers and cryptography — I like deepening my CS foundations when time allows.

## What this blog is about

This blog is an attempt to organize my knowledge and experience through creating content. I started it because I wanted to contribute more content on low-level C++, systems programming, and computer architecture. I also write about my OMSCS experience.
