So, the blog is live.

I've been meaning to start writing for a while, but kept putting it off — no time, nothing interesting to say, the usual excuses. At some point I realized: if I wait for the perfect moment, it's never going to come.

I plan to write about what I work with and interesting things I learn along the way: C++, performance, concurrency, tooling, some CS theory. There won't be a regular schedule — I'd rather post less frequently but with something actually useful than churn out weekly filler.

I also want to write about my experience with OMSCS (Georgia Tech's online Master's program) — it's a program worth knowing about.

Let's see how it goes.
